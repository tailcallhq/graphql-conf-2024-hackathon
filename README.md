# ðŸš€ GraphQL Conf Hackathon 2024

## Overview

Welcome to the GraphQL Hackathon 2024, where you will implement a GraphQL server that resolves data from upstream REST APIs! Your mission is to implement the GraphQL schema provided below, efficiently resolving queries while ensuring high performance and correctness.

**Challenge**: Build a GraphQL server that:

- Resolves data from upstream REST APIs.
- Implements the provided GraphQL schema.
- Handles real-world performance scenarios (e.g., multiple requests, nested resolvers).
- The fastest and most reliable implementation wins the top prize!

## Challenge Details

### Objective

Participants must implement a GraphQL API that resolves data from an upstream REST API, provided by the organizers. The data must be resolved according to the predefined schema, and the server must perform well under stress.

### Predefined Schema

The GraphQL schema that you need to implement is specified in the [schema.graphql](./schema.graphql) in the root of this repository.

### Data Source (Upstream REST API)

Your GraphQL server will need to fetch data from the upstream REST API at:

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`

Endpoints:

- /posts (returns a list of posts)
- /posts/:id (returns a post by ID)
- /users (returns a list of users)
- /users/:id (returns a user by ID)

The structure of the REST API responses will match the GraphQL schema fields.

### GraphQL server

Your GraphQL server should start on url `http://localhost:8000/graphql` and serve `POST` Graphql requests on it.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository locally or run the codespace of your choice
3. Add new folder to `./projects` folder with your username. Copy the `/template` folder content from the repository root to your folder to populate required files.
4. Add the code of the implementation inside the folder
	- you could use any language or tool by your choice that allows you to create the required GraphQL server. Just make sure the solution could be replicated in Github Actions environment
	- follow requirements from [Challenge Details](#challenge-details)
	- use the `schema.graphql` file from the root of the repo. Feel free to copy the file to your folder and change it the way you needed to work properly, but don't change the structure of types
5. Add `run.sh` file that installs required tools and runs the server
	- the script is running on [Github Hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners). List of available tools and packages could be found [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md)
	- first add installation and build steps for required tools and code. E.g. `npm i` or `cargo build --release`
	- add steps to start the server. E.g. `npm start` or `cargo run --release`
	- make sure the script is marked as executable `chmod +x run.sh`
6. Make sure your code is working and handles GraphQL requests
7. Commit and push changes to your fork
8. Create a pull request from your fork into original repository
